# PuzzlePalace

Puzzle Palace is an interactive game designed for the ages 12 and above, where players can solve puzzles and work together/individually escape virtual escape rooms. The goal of the project is to create a fun, accessible, and educational experience that builds problem solving and teamwork skills that can keep teens engaged. This app addresses the business problem of limited, affordable, and age-appropriate entertainment options by offering a digital alternative to costly, in-person escape rooms. Resources should be invested into this as it meets a growing demand for interactive, youth-focused digital entertainment that blends learning with fun.
